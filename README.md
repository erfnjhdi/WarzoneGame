This project is a full-featured simulation of the strategy game Warzone, developed in C++ as part of an advanced program design with C++ course. It was built in multiple phases, covering everything from map loading and player management to command parsing, game logic, and AI player strategies. The final version includes a fully playable command-line version of the game and an automated tournament mode with multiple AI behavior types.

What the Project Does
* Simulates a full game loop for Warzone, including map setup, player turns, reinforcements, order issuing and execution.
* Uses object-oriented principles, including design patterns like Strategy, Observer, and Adapter.
* Implements AI-controlled players with different strategies (aggressive, benevolent, neutral, cheater) and tournament functionality.
* Supports loading maps, validating them, processing game commands, issuing and executing orders, and dynamic state transitions.

What I achieved in this project
* Designed and implemented complex game logic from scratch based on real game rules.
* Applied major C++ design patterns:
  * Observer – for logging game events and actions.
  * Strategy – to enable dynamic player behavior.
  * Adapter – to switch between file and console command inputs.
* Using stream operators, copy constructors, and handling dynamic memory safely in C++.
* Building AI behaviors in game design and managing user interaction.
* Worked alongside a team of 4 other classmates, improving collaboration and communication.
